# Climate Change Does Not Induce Internal Migration
---

H. Sterling Burnett’s article Sorry, World Bank and Mainstream Media, Climate Change Not Driving Immigration refutes the idea of climate change induced internal migration. According to the World Bank’s Groundswell report, an estimated 216 million people in six regions will migrate within their own countries due to climate change driven effects – namely, increased water scarcity, declining crop production, and sea-level rises. However, Burnett does not believe this to be true. They claim that climate change has in fact improved crop production. If anything, internal migration will be a by-product of the economic development the increased crop production will provide. Burnett also questions the validity of computer-generated climate models responsible, citing how previous prognostications based on these models have not come true. 

There are a couple of flaws to Burnett’s arguments. To begin, the source they use to support their increased crop production claim does not appear credible. For one, that source does not cite any of their claims, which include how carbon dioxide works as an aerial fertilizer and therefore assists in plant growth and resistance to environmental changes. Even if it was a credible source, the increased crop production was only observed in cereal crops. There is no mention of other agricultural products, which could very well have decreased crop production due to climate change. In addition, the Groundswell report had named three factors behind climate change induced migration: increased water scarcity, declining crop production, and sea-level rises. Burnett only addresses one of these three factors in their article. As such, even if they managed to illustrate that crop production wasn’t a factor, the other two may very well cause internal migration. 

As for the validity of computer-generated climate models, the two previous prognostications they cited also have no valid basis. For one, they both do not have a valid citation, as they are from another citation-less blog post. Though the figure showing the “declining” number of disaster events was indeed from a United Nations report, it was taken entirely out of context. In the report it was sourced from, the graph was in fact showing how the number of disaster events had remained relatively stable from 2000-2019, not a decrease.

Both of the citations used in this paper were from The Heartland Institute, an organization which Burnett is the managing editor and research fellow for. A quick Google search reveals that The Heartland Institute is a policy think tank with conservative and libertarian views. Furthermore, they are known for their rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change. Having this knowledge alone is enough to raise concerns about the validity and impartiality of the content they produce, which is funny considering that Burnett mentions journalistic integrity in his article.
